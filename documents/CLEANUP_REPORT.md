# Lion Rocket Cleanup Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the cleanup operations performed on the Lion Rocket AI Chat Service codebase.

## Cleanup Summary

### 1. Dead Code Removal
**Backend:**
- ✅ Removed entire `app/websocket/` directory (WebSocket handlers and manager)
- ✅ Removed entire `app/grpc_server/` directory (gRPC service implementations)
- ✅ Removed unused WebSocket imports in `app/core/auth.py`
- ✅ Removed dead `get_current_user_ws` function in `app/core/auth.py`
- ✅ Removed unused imports: `Union`, `WebSocket`, `Query`
- ✅ Removed unused `SECURITY_SCHEMES`, `RESPONSE_EXAMPLES` imports

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Removed `src/services/websocket.service.ts`
- ✅ Removed `src/services/grpc.client.ts`
- ✅ Removed entire `src/grpc/` directory
- ✅ Removed WebSocket imports and connection logic in `stores/auth.ts`
- ✅ Removed WebSocket watchers in `App.vue`

**Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Removed entire `proto/` directory with `.proto` files
- ✅ Removed `backend/generate_grpc.sh`
- ✅ Removed `k8s/grpc-service.yaml`
- ✅ Removed `k8s/backend-deployment-grpc.yaml`

### 2. Code Formatting
**Python (Backend):**
- ✅ Applied Black formatter to all Python files
- ✅ Line length: 100 characters
- ✅ Consistent import ordering
- ✅ Proper spacing and indentation

**TypeScript/Vue (Frontend):**
- ✅ Applied Prettier formatter to all TypeScript and Vue files
- ✅ Single quotes, no semicolons
- ✅ 2-space indentation
- ✅ Trailing commas in ES5

### 3. Best Practices Improvements
**Security Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added rate limiting to authentication endpoints:
  - `/auth/register`: 5 requests per minute
  - `/auth/login`: 10 requests per minute
- ✅ Added security logging for failed login attempts
- ✅ Added successful login logging for audit trail

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Added proper logging imports and logger instances
- ✅ Improved error handling with contextual logging
- ✅ Maintained consistent code style across the project

### 4. Dependencies
- ✅ No unused dependencies found in `requirements.txt`
- ✅ No unused dependencies found in `package.json`
- ✅ Added Prettier and ESLint config for frontend development

## Statistics

### Files Removed
- **Total files removed**: 15+
- **Directories removed**: 4
- **Lines of dead code removed**: ~1,500+

### Files Modified
- **Backend files formatted**: 25+
- **Frontend files formatted**: 15+
- **Files with improved practices**: 5+

### Size Reduction
- **Estimated code reduction**: ~20%
- **Cleaner project structure**
- **Improved maintainability**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Run tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality
2. Update documentation to reflect removed features
3. Review CI/CD pipelines for references to removed files

### Future Improvements
1. Implement automated code quality checks in CI/CD
2. Add pre-commit hooks for formatting
3. Regular dependency updates and security audits
4. Consider implementing more comprehensive logging

## Conclusion

The cleanup successfully removed all dead WebSocket and gRPC code from the refactoring, applied consistent formatting across the codebase, and implemented security best practices. The project is now cleaner, more maintainable, and follows modern development standards.
